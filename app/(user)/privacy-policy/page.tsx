        Welcome to Frontend Roadmap. We are committed to protecting your privacy

        We use Vercel Web Analytics for collecting data for analytics. When
        using Vercel Web Analytics, no personal identifiers that track and
        cross-check end users' data across different applications or websites,
        are collected. We do not collect or store any information that would
        enable us to reconstruct an end userâ€™s browsing session across different
        applications or websites and/or personally identify an end user. A
        minimal amount of data is collected and it is used for aggregated
        statistics only.
